# 1337 Curriculum Projects

Welcome to my 1337 Curriculum Projects repository! This repository is a collection of my projects and exercises completed as part of the 1337 school curriculum. Over the next two years, I will be updating this repository with various coding challenges, libraries, and applications that demonstrate my growth and development in software engineering.

## About the 1337 Curriculum

The 1337 curriculum is part of the internationally recognized **42 Network**, known for its innovative, project-based approach to learning. This rigorous program emphasizes self-study, peer collaboration, and real-world problem-solving skills, covering topics such as low-level programming, algorithms, system administration, and more.

## Projects Overview

This repository will feature various projects as I progress through the curriculum. Below are the main areas of focus, with examples of the types of projects I plan to include.

### Completed Projects

- **Libft**: Implementation of a custom C library that mimics standard C functions, focusing on understanding pointers, memory allocation, and structuring reusable code.
- **Linked Lists**: Developing custom implementations of linked lists and exploring their applications.

### Upcoming Projects

- **Get Next Line**: A function that reads a single line from a file descriptor, providing an essential utility for file handling in C.
- **printf**: A custom version of the `printf` function, handling different types of output formatting, an exercise in function management and modular coding.
- **ft_ls**: Recreation of the Unix `ls` command, building familiarity with system calls, directory handling, and recursion.

### Additional Topics

As I advance, I will also cover areas such as:

- **Data Structures**: Implementing stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables.
- **Algorithms**: Learning sorting, searching, and optimization algorithms, and applying them to solve complex problems.
- **Networking and System Programming**: Working with sockets, multi-threading, and inter-process communication.
- **Shell**: Developing a basic shell interpreter, understanding command parsing, process management, and execution.

## Project Structure

Each project will contain:

- **Source Code**: The main code files for each project.
- **Makefile**: For compiling and building the project, where applicable.
- **README**: A detailed description of the project, its purpose, and how it works.
- **Tests**: Any test cases used to verify functionality and performance.

## Why This Repository?

Documenting my projects in this repository allows me to:

1. Track my progress and growth throughout the 1337 curriculum.
2. Share my code and solutions with peers and others in the open-source community.
3. Gain valuable feedback to refine my skills and approach.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the projects, read the descriptions, and explore the code. Feedback, suggestions, and collaboration requests are always welcome!
